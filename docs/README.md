## 🎯 Diagram Types Overview

### 1. Class Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Show system structure and relationships
- **Files**: 
  - `core-models.md` - User management and authentication
  - `service-management.md` - Services, pricing, and rides
  - `ecommerce-models.md` - Products, purchases, and car rentals

### 2. Use Case Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Define system functionality and user interactions
- **Files**: 
  - `system-overview.md` - Complete system use cases for all user types

### 3. Sequence Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Show interaction flows and API communications
- **Files**: 
  - `ride-booking-flow.md` - Complete ride booking process sequences

### 4. Activity Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Model business processes and workflows
- **Files**: 
  - `business-processes.md` - Key business process flows

### 5. Deployment Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Show system deployment and infrastructure
- **Files**: 
  - `production-architecture.md` - Production deployment strategies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Viewing Diagrams
All diagrams are written in Mermaid syntax and can be viewed in:
- GitHub (native Mermaid support)
- VS Code with Mermaid extension
- Online Mermaid editors
- Documentation sites that support Mermaid

### Using the Diagrams

1. **For Development**: Use class diagrams to understand data models
2. **For API Design**: Reference sequence diagrams for interaction flows
3. **For Requirements**: Use use case diagrams for feature planning
4. **For DevOps**: Use deployment diagrams for infrastructure setup
5. **For Business Analysis**: Use activity diagrams for process optimization

## 📊 Key System Components

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Customers, Providers, Admins
- **Services**: Transportation, Food Delivery, Maintenance, Car Rental, E-commerce
- **Rides**: Booking, tracking, completion, rating
- **Products**: Catalog, purchases, inventory
- **Pricing**: Zone-based, dynamic pricing with peak hours

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework with Channels
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with spatial extensions
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions and real-time data
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Background**: Celery for async task processing
- **Notifications**: Firebase FCM and WhatsApp integration

## 🔧 Maintenance Guidelines

### Updating Diagrams
1. **Code Changes**: Update class diagrams when models change
2. **API Changes**: Update sequence diagrams for new endpoints
3. **Feature Changes**: Update use case diagrams for new functionality
4. **Process Changes**: Update activity diagrams for workflow modifications
5. **Infrastructure Changes**: Update deployment diagrams for new architecture

### Best Practices
- Keep diagrams in sync with code
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include business rules in diagram descriptions
- Version control all diagram changes
- Review diagrams during code reviews

## 🎨 Diagram Conventions

### Color Coding
- **Blue**: User-related entities and processes
- **Green**: Successful states and completed processes
- **Orange**: Service and business logic components
- **Purple**: Administrative and configuration elements
- **Red**: Error states and cancelled processes

### Relationship Types
- **Solid Lines**: Strong relationships and direct dependencies
- **Dashed Lines**: Weak relationships and optional dependencies
- **Arrows**: Direction of data flow or process flow

## 📈 Business Value

### For Stakeholders
- **Clear System Overview**: Understand system capabilities and limitations
- **Feature Planning**: Use diagrams for requirement gathering and planning
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues through process flows

### For Development Team
- **Architecture Understanding**: Clear view of system structure
- **API Design**: Consistent interaction patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: Identify test scenarios from use cases

### For Operations Team
- **Deployment Planning**: Infrastructure requirements and scaling
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Key components to monitor
- **Troubleshooting**: Understanding system interactions for debugging
